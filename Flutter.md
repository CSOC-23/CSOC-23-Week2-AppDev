# Storing data locally

## Persisting Key-Value based data using SharedPreferences

There are a lot of options for storing data locally. The most basic one is using the [shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) plugin.

Here is a video explaining the [shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) plugin

[Flutter: Shared Preferences In 5 Minutes | Data Persistence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyz0HrGUamc)

And a more detailed one:
[Flutter Tutorial - Shared Preferences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szOllHT1S7Y&t=395s)

or you can read this tutorial:
[Using Shared Preferences in Flutter to store data locally](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-sharedpreferences-in-flutter-to-store-data-locally/)

And what’s better than the Flutter documentations themselves :)
[Store key-value data on disk](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/persistence/key-value)

Although key-value storage is easy and convenient to use, it has limitations:

- Only primitive types can be used: int, double, bool, string, and stringList.
- It’s not designed to store a lot of data.

sqflite plugin overcomes these limitations.
